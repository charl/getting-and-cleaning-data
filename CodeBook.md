This code book describes the variables, data and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data for this project.

Unless specified otherwise, all commands were run from within a R CLI session (on GNU Linux).

**Note: All data files are kept in ./data.**

For more information on the purpose of the project and how to run the R script, see [README.md](https://github.com/charl/getting-and-cleaning-data/blob/master/README.md).
